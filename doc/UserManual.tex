\section{Physics model and code description}

\subsection{Parallelization}

TEUFEL is designed to make use of clusters of multi-core nodes. The particles are distributed over the nodes (each tracking its own sub-set of particles) while the particle coordinates are communicated between the nodes after every tracking step using the message passing interface (OpenMPI).

After the tracking every node computes the observed fields from its own set of particles. This is the most time-consuming step of the computation. It is addidionally parallelized using the shared-memory model Open-MP. This way all CPU's available on one node can cooperate to compute the fields. Only a single copy of the fields (which can be very large) needs to be held in memory. After every node has computed the fields from its own particles the total fields are gethered onto the master node (using MPI) and written to file.

As an example, when running a problem on an 8-core workstation where the fields (and necessary communication buffers) fit into the memory twice, one would start TEUFEL with 2 nodes each using 4 CPU's
\begin{lstlisting}
mpirun -n 2 --cpus-per-rank 4 --oversubscribe ./build/teufel input.xml
\end{lstlisting}

On a cluster one would have to submit a batch job with the according information.

\subsection{Testing}

\section{Input files}

The input to TEUFEL consists of a human readable XML file. The content should follow
the template given here. The code would complain if any of the essential sections
listed here were missing. Some example input files are contained in the \verb|examples/| folder.

\begin{lstlisting}
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<teufel description="description of the simulation case"
    author="author name and date of creation">
    <lattice />
    <beam />
    <tracking method="Vay" delta_t="0.001/_c" n="4000" />
    <observer />
</teufel>
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Lattice description}

The lattice node describes all external fields acting on the beam.

\subsubsection{Background fields}
Homogeneous, time-constant background fields can be defined as either electrical or magnetic
fields or both.
\begin{lstlisting}
<background>
    <E x="..." y="..." z="..." />
    <B x="..." y="..." z="..." />
</background>
\end{lstlisting}

%undulator
%    planar
%    transverse gradient
%wave
%    gaussian
%dipole
%    hard edge
%background

\subsection{Beam description}

%particle
%bunch

\subsection{Tracking definitions}

%method
%watch

\subsection{Definition of Observations}

%snapshot
%screen
%mesh
%point

\subsection{The calculator}

A simple calculator and variable engine is integrated with
the input parser. All numerical input values can be computed terms.
Variable definitions can appear at any position within the file.
All variable definitions are parsed first within a section of the input file
regardless of their sequence with respect to other entries.
However, definitions made within subsections become visible in
the superior section only after the corresponding subsection has been parsed.

A variable definition is made with the entry
\begin{lstlisting}
<calc var="name" eq="value" print="entity [unit] = " />
\end{lstlisting}
The value itself may be computed from already defined variables.
At the time of the definition a printout of the given text along with the
assigned value is generated. The print attribute can be omitted if no printout is desired.
A few variables are pre-defined. All of those have names starting with an underscore.

\subsection{elbe_u300.xml}

Notice that the screen has been shifted by half a pixel size
such that the (Nx/2, Ny/2) pixel is exactly on the axis.
That is the arrangement expected when importing the screen fields into FOBT
for further propagation of single-frequency optical beams.
